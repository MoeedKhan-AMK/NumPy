    "## MEAN() IN NUMPY\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy's `mean()` function is a fundamental tool in array computation and analysis, used to calculate the arithmetic average of elements within an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "*USAGE*:\n",
    "The `mean()` function is typically used to compute the average of an entire array or along a specific axis, helping to summarize large datasets with a single representative number. It is especially useful in statistical analysis and data preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mean = Average value*\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "`Mean = Sum of values / Number of values`\n"
